# Nonlinear-Diffusion
Solving coupled nonlinear diffusion problem using FTCS method 


Here we visualize our results using surface or mesh plots. We can play with the parameters
DX;DY and B, and try to find parameters where the solution converges to the stable
solutions, where it oscillates spatially and where it oscillates both in time and
in space.
